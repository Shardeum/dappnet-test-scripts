Automated AMM GitHub Action
This GitHub Action automates Automated Market Maker (AMM) tasks using Hardhat and Node.js. It allows you to perform AMM-related operations like adding liquidity, swapping, and removing liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain.

Prerequisites
Before using this GitHub Action, ensure that you have:

Node.js (version 18.14.2) installed.

An Alchemy API Key and replace the RPC value in your .env file with your Alchemy RPC URL.

Updated your .env file with Ethereum wallet configurations including PRIVATE_KEY, Your_Address, Receiver_Address, Spender_Address, and Operator_Address.

Updated your .env file with token addresses like TokenInAddress, TokenOutAddress, FACTORY_ADDRESS, ROUTER_ADDRESS, WETH_ADDRESS, and TOKEN_ADDRESS.

Usage
GitHub Workflow Setup: Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repository with the required workflow configuration.

Configuration File: Create a .env file in your repository with the Ethereum wallet and contract configuration as provided in your question.

Commit Changes: Commit both the .env and .github/workflows/main.yml files to your repository.

Run Workflow:

Go to your GitHub repository.

Click on the "Actions" tab.

Select the "Automated AMM" workflow.

Click the "Run workflow" button to execute the AMM tasks specified in the main.yml file.

Important: Keep your .env file secure and do not share it publicly as it contains sensitive information.

Security Considerations
As this Action involves private keys and sensitive information, exercise caution when sharing your repository with others. Utilize GitHub Secrets to securely store sensitive data and avoid exposing sensitive information in your repository.

With this GitHub Action, you can easily automate AMM tasks in your Ethereum project, making it more efficient and less error-prone.
